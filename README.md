# Nexum — Authoritative State Engine

> **State is authoritative. Transactions change state. Simulation produces state transitions. Subscriptions expose state.**

Nexum is a high-performance multiplayer backend and authoritative state engine written in Rust.
It is inspired by the ideas behind SpacetimeDB, Nakama, relational databases, realtime multiplayer
backends, and simulation engines — but it is **not** a clone of any of them. It is a new architecture.

## The three primitives

1. **Tables** — Tables are the authoritative state of the application/world. They carry schemas,
   typed columns, rows, primary keys, indexes, constraints, and version metadata.
2. **Reducers** — Reducers are authoritative state transitions. Each reducer executes inside a
   transaction (read → execute → write → validate → commit).
3. **Subscriptions** — Subscriptions are reactive views over authoritative table state, driven by
   committed change sets — never by polling.

Everything else — transactions (OCC), the memory-first storage engine, WAL + snapshots, the WASM
reducer sandbox, the simulation scheduler, the partition/worker runtime, and the QUIC/HTTP planes —
exists to make those three primitives reliable, deterministic, transactional, durable, scalable, and
extremely fast.

## Implementation status

The build follows a strict order: correctness first, distribution last.

All crates depend on `nexum-core`; `nexum-core` depends on nothing. The dependency graph is the
architecture map.

## Building and testing

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test  --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

## Running the demo server

The `nexum-server` binary is a runnable demo of the full authoritative stack
(GameServer → Runtime → World → Transaction/OCC → `Vec<Change>` → WAL →
SubscriptionRegistry → network → SDK). It creates a two-partition game, joins
players, drives server-side commands and reducers (native **and** WASM), and
connects a real SDK client over an in-process transport that authenticates,
joins, attaches, subscribes, and observes committed changes as a derived view
— including a denied call to a server-only reducer (deny-by-default exposure).

```bash
cargo run -p nexum-server                # in-memory, 8 ticks
cargo run -p nexum-server -- --ticks 20  # more simulation
cargo run -p nexum-server -- --persist data  # WAL-durable run into ./data
```

## Playing the actual game

Three distinct layers (per the roadmap):

- `nexum-game-server` — the **reusable game-server framework** (game
  instances, players, exposure, routing). Contains no game mechanics.
- `nexum-server` — the **reference Nexum stack demo** (no gameplay).
- `game-server` — the **actual playable multiplayer arena game** built on
  Nexum: authoritative gameplay reducers (native `move_player`/`player_join`/
  `respawn_player`/… and a **WASM `fire_weapon`** reducer), a TCP game
  server, and a terminal client over the real SDK/network boundary.

The simulation is authoritative. The client sends **intents** (`move_player`
with a direction, `fire_weapon` with no target — the WASM reducer scans the
arena, validates facing/cooldown/ammo, resolves the hit and damage) and the
server decides the result. The client never sends positions, health, or
identity.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the authoritative game server (1 partition, 20 ticks/s):
cargo run -p game-server -- server

# Terminals 2 and 3 — two real clients (each its own SDK + TCP connection):
cargo run -p game-server -- client --name alice
cargo run -p game-server -- client --name bob
```

Registered names: `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, `dave`. Use `--port` to change the
default `9337` and `--auto SECONDS` for a deterministic scripted player
(proves multiplayer without a keyboard).

**Controls (interactive client):** `w/a/s/d` move, `f` fire, `r` reload,
`x` respawn, `q` quit. Each render frame shows the arena, your player, other
players, health, ammo, cooldown, and the authoritative tick.

```bash
cargo run -p game-server -- server --help        # server options
cargo run -p game-server -- client --help        # client options
```
